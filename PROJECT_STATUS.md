# Project Status - Permiso RBAC Framework

This file is maintained for AI assistants to quickly understand the current state of the Permiso project when starting a new session.

## Quick Context
Permiso is a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system built with Node.js/TypeScript. It provides fine-grained permission management for multi-tenant applications through a GraphQL API. The project was extracted from the Shaman project to be a standalone, reusable RBAC solution.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Core Infrastructure
1. **permiso-core** - Core utilities, Result type, and base types
2. **permiso-logger** - Centralized logging with context support
3. **Project structure** - Monorepo setup with custom build system
4. **Docker support** - Production-ready Docker image with multi-stage build
   - Available at: `ghcr.io/codespin-ai/permiso`
   - Build scripts: `docker-build.sh` and `docker-push.sh`

### âœ… Completed RBAC Implementation
5. **permiso-server** - GraphQL server with:
   - Database schema and migrations
   - Complete persistence layer for all entities
   - GraphQL schema with all types defined
   - GraphQL resolvers for queries and mutations
   - Express server with Apollo GraphQL
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Functional programming patterns throughout
   - Result type error handling

### âœ… Database Schema
- Organizations table
- Users table with identity provider support
- Roles table
- Resources table with IDs in path-like format for permissions
- User-role assignments
- User permissions (direct)
- Role permissions
- Custom properties for all entities

### âœ… GraphQL API
#### Queries Implemented:
- `organization(id)` - Get single organization
- `organizations` - List all organizations
- `users(orgId)` - List users in organization
- `roles(orgId)` - List roles in organization
- `resources(orgId)` - List resources in organization
- `userRoles(orgId, userId)` - Get user's assigned roles
- `userPermissions(orgId, userId)` - Get user's direct permissions
- `rolePermissions(roleId)` - Get role's permissions
- `effectivePermissions(orgId, userId, resourceId)` - Calculate effective permissions

#### Mutations Implemented:
- `createOrganization` - Create new organization
- `updateOrganization` - Update organization details
- `deleteOrganization` - Delete organization
- `createUser` - Create user in organization
- `updateUser` - Update user details
- `deleteUser` - Delete user
- `createRole` - Create role
- `updateRole` - Update role details
- `deleteRole` - Delete role
- `createResource` - Create protected resource
- `updateResource` - Update resource details
- `deleteResource` - Delete resource
- `assignUserRole` - Assign role to user
- `revokeUserRole` - Remove role from user
- `grantUserPermission` - Grant direct permission to user
- `revokeUserPermission` - Revoke direct permission from user
- `grantRolePermission` - Grant permission to role
- `revokeRolePermission` - Revoke permission from role
- `setCustomProperty` - Set custom property on any entity
- `deleteCustomProperty` - Delete custom property

## Remaining Work

### ðŸ”„ Testing Framework
**Current state**: No test framework configured
**Tasks needed**:
- Set up Jest or Vitest
- Create test utilities for database setup/teardown
- Write unit tests for persistence functions
- Write integration tests for GraphQL API
- Add test coverage reporting

### ðŸ”„ API Authentication
**Current state**: No authentication implemented
**Tasks needed**:
- Add JWT or API key authentication
- Create authentication middleware
- Add auth context to GraphQL resolvers
- Implement service-to-service authentication options

### ðŸ”„ Advanced Features
**Current state**: Basic RBAC implemented
**Potential enhancements**:
- Permission inheritance for hierarchical resources
- Time-based permissions (temporary access)
- Delegation capabilities
- Audit logging for all permission changes
- Permission templates
- Bulk operations API

### ðŸ”„ Performance Optimizations
**Current state**: Basic implementation without optimizations
**Tasks needed**:
- Add caching layer for permission calculations
- Optimize effective permission queries
- Add database query performance monitoring
- Implement connection pooling configuration

### ðŸ”„ Documentation
**Current state**: Basic documentation exists
**Tasks needed**:
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Add usage examples and tutorials
- Document integration patterns
- Create migration guide from other RBAC systems

### ðŸ”„ Monitoring & Observability
**Current state**: Basic logging only
**Tasks needed**:
- Add OpenTelemetry support
- Create health check endpoints
- Add metrics for permission checks
- Implement structured logging

### ðŸ”„ CLI Tool
**Current state**: Not implemented
**Tasks needed**:
- Create CLI for database migrations
- Add commands for user/role management
- Implement permission testing tools
- Add bulk import/export functionality

## Technical Debt & Improvements

1. **Error Handling**: Currently using basic Error objects, could benefit from custom error types
2. **Validation**: Input validation could be more comprehensive
3. **Type Safety**: Some areas use `Record<string, unknown>` that could be more specific
4. **Batch Operations**: Some mutations could benefit from batch variants

## How to Get Started

1. **Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   export PERMISO_DB_HOST=localhost
   export PERMISO_DB_PORT=5432
   export PERMISO_DB_NAME=permiso
   export PERMISO_DB_USER=your_user
   export PERMISO_DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

2. **Build and Run**:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh --install --migrate
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access GraphQL Playground**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5001/graphql`
   - Use the interactive playground to test queries and mutations

## Session Start Checklist

When starting a new session:
1. Read this PROJECT_STATUS.md file
2. Read CLAUDE.md for coding conventions
3. Run `./build.sh` to ensure everything compiles
4. Check database connection with `npm run migrate:status`
5. Ask the user what they'd like to work on from the remaining options
